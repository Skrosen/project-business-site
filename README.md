# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business site with a hero header / hero image, a form with at least 3 different input types and a accordion using JavaScript.

## The problem

I used both css grid and flexbox for the assignment, I started with adding HTML and added the hero image, styling in css and ofcourse to get the accordion to work as it should using JavaScript. This assignment I worked more with the developer/inspector tool which was very helpful! If I had more time I would add an icon in the accordion next to the question that changed when the question was toggled. I would also add animation to the page if I had the time.
